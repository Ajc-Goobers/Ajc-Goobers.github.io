        We're currently working on software called PMC Hub which is similar to Jam, but with more features.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm not really a fan of the community built up around Jam, as it mostly consists of Manchildren who scam and exploit kids and then play the "They need lives" card as an excuse. The irony... So I've just decided to create my own.
      </p>

      <p>
        We'll have it avalible linked above, please note that it's a WIP project and I haven't worked on the Backend much yet. But if you're a C# dev or know a thing or two about Electron feel free to help out.

          <h1>Pedophile on Ajc.</h1>
          <p>
            Before I begin explaining this situation, I just want to point out that this isnt the typical "omg this person is a pedo because someone else told me so" scenario. Which often
            has little to no proof that the person is a pedo, and typically ends up being some lie someone made up. Or the supposed pedo doesn't even have the mental capacity to understand and a pedophile is. (Having a sort of mental disability, or retardation if you prefer.)           
          </p>

          <p>
            So with that out of the way, heres what happened; This morning I was contacted by a user who I will just call beta. Beta informed me that she knew a user who was a pedophile that she had interacted with, and that she would like them to be put on a blacklist server that I own. She stated the following:

               Hi, i'm an ex (victim) of ixlo also know as ILOVEJAMMINGAJ


                i knew him from an ex friend that's his ex.  i only added him to send him proof about her cheating. anyways fast forward he starts like talking to me and flirting with me calling me pretty and all that jazz and always calling me. i felt there was something off about him. anyways him and i “dated” i don't online date he just saw it as us dating. i played along. till the point where he would call me always trying to sext or dirty talk me about what he wants to do to my private parts. and how much he would do. keep in mind i'm under the impression he's 20. i told him i was only 18. anyways. he ends up getting mad bc i felt uncomfortable talking to him and just stayed on mute and blocks me and spreads lies about me. fast forward about 3 weeks he wants to be all buddy buddy with me after i exposed him and the girl he got with right after me. (dark orchard) now he's with YVZICE. and many other girls such as EXAPHOBIA. 
                
                one of the girls is 15, he claims to be 21

            So in short, theres a guy who goes by the username "Ilovejammingaj" who this user contacted about relationship shiz, which quickly turns into him being very sexual towards her, as well as harassing the user. He's now doing the same thing to many other girls he finds on Ajc, many being underage mind you, and yes, I did make sure he had sufficient knowledge of this. This is taking place both on Ajc, and outside of it on Discord and such. His Ajc account was banned luckily, his Ajc username was ixlo. I'm going to be linking many screenshots from Victims and such at the end of the post in a GitHub repository, which will include his social media accounts, things he has said, Victims interactions with him etc. And yes I was given permission by all of the Victims of this guy to post these.
          </p>

          <p>
            There is now a Group Chat in which I am in with all of the Victims, and we are centralizing all information found there. He apparently has also used some of the Victims to get items, diamonds, etc out of them. I just wanted to make this post to raise awareness about this guy. Do not let anyone into your server that does by the username ixlo, Ilovejammingaj, or anything similar.
          </p>

          <p>
            Please note that athorities are involved, please to not harass, or attempt to contact anyone mentioned in this post. It's all being taken care of. If anything else happen's i'll be making a second post. Or if you have information about him, please contact a moderaor through the PMC server.
          </p>
